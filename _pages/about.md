I am a PhD student in Public Policy at Northeastern University. My research delves into the intricate relationship between Development Economics and Public Policy. Before joining Northeastern, I earned my Master’s in Applied Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University. My professional journey includes roles at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. I contributed to developing an open-source database spotlighting the representation of Indian Parliamentarians at Development Data Lab. 
Furthermore, I taught Statistics and Microeconomics to senior-secondary students at the Delhi Government School, all in New Delhi. <br>

While many scholars across various disciplines have studied marginalized communities, I aim to infuse my research with my personal experiences and insights to provide a fresh perspective. I am particularly passionate about highlighting the voices and concerns of underrepresented groups in the field of economics and development, ensuring they are adequately addressed in policy considerations. <br>

Research Interest
------
I enjoy integrating questions from various disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, and political science, with economic principles to gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of the issues at hand.  As a development and labor economist, I focus on the intersections of education, caste, class, and gender, working towards developing effective solutions through experiments designed to enhance labor market efficiency.
